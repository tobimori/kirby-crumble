# Kirby Crumble

Crumble is a feature-rich cookie consent plugin for Kirby CMS. Unlike the existing solutions, it focuses on providing a compliant backend API that tracks and logs consents.

By default, it uses the known [cookieconsent](https://github.com/orestbida/cookieconsent/tree/master) library by [Orest Bida](https://github.com/orestbida), however you can also use your own implementation and simply use Crumble for providing the backend infrastructure. (and I might add support for different frontends such as [c15t](https://c15t.com/) in the future)

Crumble is currently available as free-to-use Beta version while in active development. It is not a free plugin and will require a paid license upon release.

## License

Kirby Crumble is not free software. In order to run it on a public server, you'll have to purchase a valid Kirby license & a [valid Crumble license](https://plugins.andkindness.com/crumble/pricing).
